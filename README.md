# Tarator
A game engine written in 100% rust with a strong focus on cross platform functionality and ease of use. 
We take inspiration from other GUI driven engines such as godot but also pure code engines such as the bevy engine.

## Usage
Right now there is not much to see here but the goal is to a. just download prebuilt binaries or b. build it from source with cargo install.
